Step 1 

1. Install Charles Proxy 
2. Install the chosen app on my ios device *Ricardo.ch*
3. Configure proxy manual => local server and port from Charles 
4. Install Charles SSL certificate 
SSL - Secure Sockets Layer, a global standard security technology that enables encrypted communication between a web browser and a web server. 
In order to create this secure connection, a SSL certificate is installed on a web server and serves 2 functions: 

It authenticates the identity of the website (this guarantees visitors that they’re not on a bogus site)
It encrypts the data that’s being transmitted

5. Listen to the network traffic and enter the app on the ios device. 
  In my case, I've chosen the API with a list of the newest articles. 
6. Copy the cURL request and convert it into a Python request 
7. In PyCharm -> receive a json file by sending a get request 
8.
